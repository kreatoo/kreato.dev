# Building things for a tinkerer, by a tinkerer
I am a novice programmer, Linux and Windows System Administrator and a Free Software advocate.

I build tools/general software aimed at the tinkerer.

I am the founder of [Kreato Linux](https://linux.kreato.dev) and i also made multiple smaller projects.

My hobbies include music, anime, retro computers, the usual geek stuff.

This website include my blogs.

# Languages I know
I know Nim, Python, Bash/POSIX sh, HTML5, CSS, sass, some PowerShell and some Svelte.

I use Nim for most tasks.

# Software I use
I use Fedora on my computer, with these applications;

* Password manager: 1Password
* Browser: Vivaldi
* Note-taking app: Obsidian
* Chat: Discord, Telegram
* Office: Onlyoffice
* Editor: (Neo)Vim with a couple of plugins

Software I use changes overtime and this list may not be up-to-date.
