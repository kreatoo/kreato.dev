# Building things for a tinkerer, by a tinkerer
I am a novice programmer, Linux and Windows System Administrator/DevOps Engineer and a Free Software advocate.

I build tools/general software aimed at the tinkerer.

I am the founder of [Kreato Linux](https://linux.kreato.dev) and i also made multiple smaller projects.

My hobbies include music, anime, retro computers, the usual geek stuff.

# Languages I know
I know Nim, Python, Bash/POSIX sh, Go, HTML5, CSS, sass, some PowerShell and some Svelte.

I use Nim for most tasks, but I mainly use Go at work.

* Terminal: iTerm2
* Password manager: 1Password
